# KOREAN SMEs Development Policy

**KOREAN SMEs Development Policy:**

1960s

Korean SME policies roots dates back to 1961 when the first laws (Small and Medium Enterprise Cooperatives act, Adjustment of Projects for Small and Medium Enterprises Act) were enacted. 

- This effort was extended in 1962 with supports from many fronts establishing Korea Federation of SMEs to coordinate better SME policies, Industrial Bank of Korea to provide financial support, and Korea Trade Agency (KOTRA) to promote trade (mainly export).
- Although the policies during the 60s where highly important in creating the fundaments of the korean SMEs it is not recommended to be benchmarked per se by other countries since its policy where highly selective and involved extreme government interventions. 
For example: Korean government selected exporting companies to specially provide benefits, also regulated by law that a 30% of total lending in commercial banks should be provided to SMEs.

1970s

While during the 60s the government provided a wholistic support to SMEs, the government took a more ***strategic approach*** from the 70s selecting ***strategic industrial fields*** in 1971. 

- The strategic approach consisted of two tracks: Raising stability (financial, and market) and Protecting from competition.
    - Traditional SMEs
        - The main strategies for traditional SMEs were to modernize the infrastructure by: financial assistance, technical assistance, scaling, priority in entering industrial district, control production from large conglomerates, limit import, infant industry protection policies
    - Technical SMEs
        - The main strategies for technical SMEs were: 
        replacement of old facilities, technology development, subsidiary relationship with large conglomerates, prevention of payment delays, securing long-term contracts.

Also during this period the Korean government created the “industry promoting agency” to control the industrial standards and quality of the Korean produced products. 

- In an important effort to create national demands of SMEs, the Korean government created general trading companies (무역회사/상사). The purpose of establishing general trading companies was to create companies that could almost entirely focus in the promotion of export.
- Another important aspect that helped the flourishing of SMEs was the establishment of the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund (KODIT), which helped guarantee SMEs with lack of collaterals.
