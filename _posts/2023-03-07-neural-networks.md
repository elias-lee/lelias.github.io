# What is an Artificial Neural Network?

Neural networks are a subset of Machine Learning and the essence of deep learning algorithms. 

An artificial neural network is composed of 1)node-layer [a.k.a input] 2)hidden-layers [singular or plural] 3)output layer. 

Each layer has its weights and threshold.
