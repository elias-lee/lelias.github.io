🇺🇸 Robert Solow's seminal paper “A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth.” was published in 1956. 

There are important assumption that must be set to understand this model 
1. Countries produce and consume a single homogenous good. 
2. technology is exogenous
3. no international trade

# The Basic Solow Model
Solow's model is built around two equations, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a production function</mark> and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">capital accumulation equation.</mark> 

## Production Function
The Production function describes how ***inputs*** combine to produce output.[^1] Inputs are grouped into two categories 💵 capital <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">$K$</mark> and 👷 labor <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">$L$</mark>. The production function is assumed to have a cobb-douglass form. 

$$ Y = F(K,L) = K^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}$$

- $\alpha = [0,1]$  
this means that the function have constant return to scale. [^2]

Now that we have the function we need to define the cost of labor and capital. Lets say firms pay <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">$w$</mark> wage and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">$r$</mark> rent for each unit of labor and capital respectively. Here we assume perfect competition prevails (firms are price takers). 

$$\max_{K,L} F(K,L)-rK-wL$$

Solving the __*first-order condition*__ firms will hire until <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">marginal product of labor equals wage and marginal product of capital equals rent</mark>

$$w=\frac{\delta F}{\delta L} = (1-\alpha)\frac{Y}{L}, \\ \ \\ \text{Share of output paid to labor} \qquad w\frac{L}{Y} = 1-\alpha\\ \ \\ r = \frac{\delta F}{\delta K} = \delta \frac{Y}{K} \\ \ \\ \text{Share of output paid to capital} \qquad r\frac{K}{Y}=\alpha$$ 


Now what we are really interested is in finding output per worker or per capita output thus replacing $y \equiv\frac{Y}{L}$ and $k\equiv\frac{K}{L}$ the original function [$Y = F(K,L) = K^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}$] gives us: 

$$y=k^\alpha $$

## Capital Accumulation
<!-- TODO: from page 24  -->


















[^1]: Remember production function measures only physical quantities, however this does not mean that output consists only of tangible goods. 

[^2]: Although any value from 0 to 1 is possible Cobb and Douglas proposed that in case of U.S manufacturing $\alpha=\frac{1}{4}$ fits generally very well.
