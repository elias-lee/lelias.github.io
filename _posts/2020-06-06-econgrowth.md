The Fundamental question of "Why are some countries richer than others?" have long troubled economists. The modern examination of this question dates back to two seminal papers: one by **Robert Solow** and the other by **Paul Romer** and **Robert Lucas**.

## Robert Solow
Solow's paper stressed the importance of **Physical Capital** and **Technological Progress**.

## Paul Romer and Robert Lucas 
Romer and Lucas reignited the discussion on economic growth emphasizing the economics of **ideas** and **human capital**. Moreover, Romer introduced the **Economics of technology to Macroeconomists** 

These theoretical advances was taken on by Rober Barro who quantified and tested this theories.

## The Data of Growth and Development.

The textbook focuses in the measure of income per capita for the reasons below:
- Theories developed in subsequent chapters are couched in terms of per capita income.
- Good "summary statistic" since is correlated with other measures of quantity of life.

## Facts
The book mentions "4" *Stylized Facts* that are broadly applied to the countries in the world and "3" others that describes some features of the U.S economy but also generally applied to other countries "In the long run"

### FACT 1
There is enormous variation in per capita income across economies. The poorest countries have per capita incomes that are less than 5 percent of per capita incomes in the richest countries.

#### GDP per capita vs GDP per worker
The only difference is in the denominator
$$ \text{GDP Per Capita} = \frac{GDP}{population} \quad \text{GDP Per Worker} = \frac{GDP}{Labor} \\ \ \\ \text{Labor Force Participation Rate} = \frac{Labor}{population}$$ 

### FACT 2
Rates of economic growth vary substantially across countries. 

A useful way to interpret these growth rates was provided by Robert E. Lucas, Jr., in a paper titled ‚ÄúOn the Mechanics of Economic Development‚Äù.
According to Lucas a country growing $g$ percent per year will double its per capita income every $\frac{70}{g}$ years.

$$ Y(t) = Y_0 e^{gt^*} \rightarrow t^* = \frac{log2}{g}$$

Where $Y(t)$ Per-capita Income at time $t$ and $Y_0$ initial value. 

### FACT 3
Growth rates are not generally constant over time. For the world as a whole, growth rates were close to zero over most of history but have increased sharply in the twentieth century. For individual countries, growth rates also change over time.

### FACT 4
A country‚Äôs relative position in the world distribution of per capita incomes is not immutable. Countries can move from being ‚Äúpoor‚Äù to being ‚Äúrich,‚Äù and vice versa.

## Other Stylized Facts
They are general characteristics of most economies ‚Äúin the long run.‚Äù
### FACT 5 
In the United States over the last century,
1.  the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">*real rate of return to capital*</mark>, r, shows no trend upward or downward;
2.  the shares of income devoted to capital, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">$\frac{rK}{Y}$</mark>, and labor, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">$\frac{wL}{Y}$</mark>, show no trend; and
3.  the average <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">growth rate of output per person</mark> has been <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">*positive*</mark> and relatively <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">*constant*</mark> over time ‚Äî that is, the United States exhibits steady, sustained per capita income growth.

#### Kaldors Stylized Facts
This stylized fact, is drawn largely from a lecture given by Nicholas Kaldor at a 1958 conference on capital accumulation (Kaldor 1961)

1) Kaldor‚Äôs Ô¨Årst fact <br>
The rate of return to capital is roughly constant‚Äî is best seen by noting that the real interest rate on government debt in the U.S. economy shows no trend.[^1]

[^1]: We do not observe real interest rates, but we can calculate $$ \text{Real Interest Rate} = \text{nominal interest rate} - \text{expected/actual rate of inflation} $$

2) Kaldor's second fact <br>
Factors of production can group into capital and labor. [^2] 
In the U.S the labor share has been relatively constant over time, at a value of around 0.7

This together with the first fact imply that $$ \frac{K}{Y} $$ is roughly constant in the U.S

[^2]: For the United States, one can calculate labor‚Äôs share of GDP by looking at wage and salary payments and compensation for the self-employed as a share of GDP

3) Kaldor's third fact <br>
Third fact is a slight reinterpretation of one of Kaldor‚Äôs stylized facts. GDP per capita growth has a growing trend at a rate of 1.8% per year. 

### FACT 6
Growth in output and growth in the volume of international trade are closely related.

### FACT 7
Both skilled and unskilled workers tend to migrate from poor to rich countries or regions.

This fact is important to understand about the üí∞ *Real Wages*
Th reason why people are willing to pay the high cost of moving is because both skilled and unskilled labor must be higher in high-income regions 

In short: 
<p style="text-align: center;"> Work pays better in high-income regions </p>
