The Fundamental question of "Why are some countries richer than others?" have long troubled economists. The modern examination of this question dates back to two seminal papers: one by *Robert Solow* and the other by *Paul Romer* and *Robert Lucas*.

## Robert Solow
Solow's paper stressed the importance of **Physical Capital** and **Technological Progress**.

### Paul Romer and Robert Lucas 
Romer and Lucas reignited the discussion on economic growth emphasizing the economics of **ideas** and **human capital**. Moreover Romer introduced the *Economics of technology to Macroeconomists* 

These theoretical advances was taken on by Rober Barro who quantified and tested this theories.
