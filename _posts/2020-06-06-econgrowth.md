The Fundamental question of "Why are some countries richer than others?" have long troubled economists. The modern examination of this question dates back to two seminal papers: one by **Robert Solow** and the other by **Paul Romer** and **Robert Lucas**.

## Robert Solow
Solow's paper stressed the importance of **Physical Capital** and **Technological Progress**.

## Paul Romer and Robert Lucas 
Romer and Lucas reignited the discussion on economic growth emphasizing the economics of **ideas** and **human capital**. Moreover, Romer introduced the **Economics of technology to Macroeconomists** 

These theoretical advances was taken on by Rober Barro who quantified and tested this theories.

## The Data of Growth and Development.

The textbook focuses in the measure of income per capita for the reasons below:
- Theories developed in subsequent chapters are couched in terms of per capita income.
- Good "summary statistic" since is correlated with other measures of quantity of life.
