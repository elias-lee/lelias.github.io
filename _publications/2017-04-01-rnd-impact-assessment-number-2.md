Paper Summary:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This research is a follow-up research of “Impact Assessment of R&D Investment: Framework Building and a Pilot Analysis” carried in 2016. During the research of 2016, the research focused in assessing the impact of the R&D investment from the economic and social perspective using Propensity Score Matching(PSM) method. The research concluded that the R&D investment from the government does not influence positively, economically and socially, to firms. However, it is equally important to assess the impact to the growth of a firm. Thus, in this paper we analyzed the impact of government funded R&D investment to the growth of a company using different methods.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the OLS analysis results showed that the internal investment in R&D had a positive influence to the middle and long term growth of the company. However commissioned and trusted R&D was not probed to be effective to the development of a company.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the PSM analysis showed different results depending on which variable was used as a reference, results showed that government R&D influences positively to the fast growth of a firm when employment is used as reference. However, the results showed government R&D not to be effective when revenue was used as reference of fast growth. Thus, it is hard to define the effective of government R&D on the fast growth of a company.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the impact of R&D when revenue is considered as reference showed that R&D investment influenced the growth of a firm from the second year throughout the fourth year, moreover R&D investment showed a direct effect in export increase.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, the analysis using Korea Enterprise Data(KED) data showed that when capital stock and revenues are below certain level the firm is more likely to grow however, when capital stock and revenues are not stable the firm is more likely to decline. Moreover, the government guarantee on R&D has proven to help in the quantitative growth but not in it’s quality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, this paper concludes with the following policy recommendations. Since the study showed that government R&D is not effective in the growth of a firm, it is recommendable for the government to support an analysis study on the effectiveness of government R&D. Moreover, it is imperative to review measures to dramatically improve the government R&D support system.
