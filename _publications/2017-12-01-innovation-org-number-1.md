Paper Summary:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this study is to define creative organizations and to explore the main attributes of those creative innovation organizations. Explorer how they continuously generate creative ideas and build social and economic performance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this study, a pool of creative innovative case studies was prepared using various innovative companies' ranking announced by global consulting firms. The subjects were selected according to the countries and industries in which the companies are located. We also added a creative innovation organization in the content industry and named the creative industry. Content creators, on the other hand, do not belong to the rankings of innovative companies based on technical indicators such as patents, although creativity is the core competitiveness. In addition to the theoretical factors mentioned above, the purpose of this study was to find out the new factors of creative innovation organizations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analysis of the case study shows that there is a tentative prototype that constitutes a creative organization, but the way that it is realized is different due to industrial characteristics, national context, and specific business characteristics. In this study, based on case studies, we derive a prototype of characteristics of creative innovation, which is a collection of institutions, cultures and tools adopted by creative innovation organizations for creative performance creation. And we analyze how it has been implemented differently with a certain tendency according to the context of industries(IT/SW, Contents, Manufacturing) and regions(US/Europe, Japan, Korea).

The prototype of creative innovation organization attributes is as follows:
1. Inflow of creative researchers
2. Minimize the environment that interferes with immersion
3. Business context to promote commitment
4. Teamwork culture that pursues participative and open collaborative communication
5. Attempts and failures, strategic scale-up, capitalization of failure experience
6. Learning culture that forms the foundation of cooperation
7. Leadership and systems for building and sustaining creative organizational culture

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The seven main attributes that characterize the prototype of a creative innovation organization have evolved adaptively according to the needs of the context in which they are organized and have been implemented in different ways. In this sense, the leadership and system for constructing and sustaining the creative organizational culture, the seventh attribute, is a driving force for continuously pursuing the prototypical attributes of the creative innovation organization and changing to the most appropriate form in the area of each organization. Therefore, the first principle of creative innovation organizational design is to make the creation of creative organization a core value, and there must be a power to continuously strive for it. Because creative innovation organization is formed based on context-dependent and member participation, it means that the answer to be a creative innovation organization should come from inside rather than outside.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussions related to the previous research environment are mainly focused on improvement of researcher 's treatment and improvement of research convenience, and it is based on the assumption that the achievement of these factors will be directly linked to the creation of a creative research environment. However, the establishment of a creative research environment requires a more comprehensive approach and, above all, an understanding of the process of creativity and
